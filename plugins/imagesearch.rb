# = Cinch Google Image Search plugin
# Searches Google Images and returns the first result.
#
# == Configuration
# Add the following to your bot's configure.do stanza:
#
#   config.plugins.options[Cinch::ImageSearch] = {
#     :google_api_key => "",
#     :search_engine_id => ""
#   }
#
# [google_api_key]
#   Using Google's API Console, create an API key for this plugin. See:
#   https://support.google.com/googleapi/answer/6158862?hl=en
#  
# [search_engine_id]
#   This plugin works by creating a Google Custom Search Engine that searches
#   the entire web, but then filters down to just image results. You will need
#   to add the "Search engine ID" provided by your CSE to the bot config file.
#   See: https://cse.google.com/cse/all
